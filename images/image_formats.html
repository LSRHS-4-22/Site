<h1>Description of three main image formats in use on the web</h1>
<p> Gifs are one of the 3 main image formats on the web today. Gifs have only 256 colors. Gifs cant do gradients very well, they dont show up as well. So, things with a large surface area of any solid color would work great.</p>

<p> The second of the three formats is a JPG. A jpeg format is the best one to use when you have complex images with complicated effects. There are alot of colors involved with jpgs. You can adjust the setting of your image.</p>

<p> The third and final format to use is a PNG format. The Png format is similar to the Gif format because there is a maximum of 256 colors. Although, Pngs have a better quality of images and it can handle transparency.
