    <p>I belive that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility and courage are all necessary components to good citizenship. Citizenship is the the position or status of being a citizen of a particular country.
    <p>Honesty means being truthful, sincere, or frank. Honesty is an important part of citizenship because you want people around you to be able to trust you and look to you for the truth. Compassion is a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering. Compassion is also very important in being a good citizen because its important to be able to relate to someones greif and help them get through tough times.
    <p>Respect means esteem for or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability. Respect is another important quality of good citizenship because to be a good citizen you want to earn the peoples around you respect, and having that respect will give you confidence. You also want to be able to respect other around you. Responsibility is the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone. Responsibilty is important in citizenship because to be a good citizen you have to understand that you have to be responsible over your actions and for your family and friends, etc.
    <p>Finally, Courage is the ability to do something that frightens one. Courage is very important in being a good citizen because you have to be able to take risks and do things you are scared of to live a full life. A good citizen would also want to have the courage to speak their minds.
    </p>
    <p> One other component of being a good citizen is to be an active participant in the community around you. This is really important because you need to be able to help whenever anything is needed in the community and help make the community a better place. The most recent great act of citizenship I recently saw on TV was the citizens of communities in florida or where ever else Hurrican Irma hit, were helping to clean up the mess afterwards. This is an act of citizenship because it includes all of the components of Citizenship, and it is very selfless.
